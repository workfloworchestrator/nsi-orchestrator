# nsi-orchestrator

The NSI orchestrator, based on the
[Workflow Orchestrator framework](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/orchestrator-core),
maintains the lifecycle of network topologies, switching
services, Service Termination Points (STP), Service Demarcation Points (SDP),
and the Multi Domain Point-to-Point (MDP2P) services across a NSI
infrastructure, using the
[NSI DDS Proxy](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/nsi-dds-proxy)
as source of information and the
[NSI Aggregator Proxy](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/nsi-aggregator-proxy)
as its Network Resource Manager (NRM).

## Project ANA-GRAM

This software is being developed by the 
[Advanced North-Atlantic Consortium](https://www.anaeng.global/), 
a cooperation between National Education and Research Networks (NRENs) and 
research partners to provide network connectivity for research and education 
across the North-Atlantic, as part of the ANA-GRAM project. 

The goal of the ANA-GRAM project is to federate the ANA trans-Atlantic links through
[Network Service Interface (NSI)](https://ogf.org/documents/GFD.237.pdf)-based automation.
This will enable the automated provisioning of L2 circuits spanning different domains 
between research parties on other sides of the Atlantic. The ANA-GRAM project is 
spearheaded by the ANA Platform & Requirements Working Group, under guidance of the 
ANA Engineering and ANA Planning Groups.
